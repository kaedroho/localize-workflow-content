"Sandwich breads are produced in many varieties, such as white, whole wheat, sourdough, rye, multigrain and others. Sandwich bread may be formulated to slice easily,[8] cleanly or uniformly, and may "
"have a fine crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a light texture.[4] Sandwich bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports "
"fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness. <a id=\"a1\">Some may be designed</a> to not become crumbly, hardened, dried or have too squishy a texture."
